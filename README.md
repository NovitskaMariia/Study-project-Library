# Django_Forms

Educational library project using Django, with a simple UI using Bootstrap.
On this site, we can register as either a regular user or a librarian. Depending on the role, different functionalities will be available.
As a user, I can browse books and add them to a cart to borrow.
As a librarian, I can add and remove books from the database using the site's UI, do the same with authors, and associate authors with books.
